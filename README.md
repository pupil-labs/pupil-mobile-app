Pupil Mobile is companion app to [Pupil Capture and Pupil Service](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases). It is currently in public alpha!

With Pupil Mobile you can connect your [Pupil headset](https://pupil-labs.com/store) via USB-C to an Android Phone and stream video data over a local network. It seamlessly integrates with Pupil Capture and Pupil Service. 

The app is free. You can download it in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pupillabs.pupilmobile).

The communication protocol is named [NDSI](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/master/ndsi-commspec.md), it is completely open. A reference client for Python exsits [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi).


## I want to use this for my experiments in the field

Feel free to do so, but do not rely on the app to work all the time.
