## Streaming To Subscribers
Pupil Mobile devices on the same local WiFi network are automatically detected by Pupil Capture.
To subscribe to a Pupil Mobile device in Pupil Capture, go to `Video Source` and select your Android Device as the video source.


#### WiFi Bandwidth & Network
Make sure you have a good WiFi newtork connection and that it's not saturated. The quality of your WiFi connection will affect the sensor streams to your subscribers. We recommend using a dedicated WiFi router.

> For streaming to work your network needs to allow <code>UDP</code> transport.
If the nodes do not find each other, create a local wifi network and use that instead.

> Make sure that your firewall is not blocking the connection.

## NDSI Communication Protocol
The communication protocol is named [NDSI](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/master/ndsi-commspec.md), it is completely open. A reference client for Python exsits [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi).

> **Warning:** The communication protocol does not implement any access control.
This means that everyone running Pupil Capture in your local network will be able to access,
i.e. stream and record, sensors connected to the phone running Pupil Mobile!
Make sure to hit "Stop background service and terminate app" in the general Pupil Mobile settings after you are done.

## Transfer Recordings
You will have to manually transfer recordings to your computer to open them in Player.
There are two different methods to archive that:

#### SD card File Transfer
This method requires

1. that you set the `Save directory` to `SD card` in the [general settings](#general-settings)
1. a SD card reader that can be connected to your computer

Once you finished the recording, remove the sd card from your phone,
insert it into the SD card reader, and connect it to your computer.
The SD card should show up on your computer as if it was a USB stick.

You can find all recodings in the `Pupil Mobile` folder on the SD card.
Copy the recording folders to a directory of your choice on your computer.
Afterwards, you can remove the SD card from the computer and open the copied recordings using Pupil Player.

#### Direct Phone Connection
1. Connect your phone via USB to your computer.
1. A notification on your phone should pop up: `Android System - USB charging this device`.
    1. Double tap the notification to open the options.
    1. Select `Use USB to transfer files`.
    1. Your phone should show up on your computer as if it was an USB stick.
1. The recordings are saved in two different locations depending on the `Save directory` settings chosen before the recording:
    1. Default: `Internal storage/Movies/Pupil Mobile`
    1. SD Card: `SD card/Pupil Mobile`
1. Copy the recording folders to a directory of your choice on your computer.
1. Disconnect the phone from your computer.
1. Open the copied recordings in Pupil Player.

> Unfortunatly, step 2.3. does not work on macOS. Please use the [Android Filetransfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) application instead.
