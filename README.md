Pupil Mobile is companion app to [Pupil Capture and Pupil Service](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases). It is currently in public alpha!

With Pupil Mobile you can connect your [Pupil headset](https://pupil-labs.com/store) via USB-C to an Android Phone and stream video data over a local network. It seamlessly integrates with Pupil Capture and Pupil Service. 

The app is free. You can download it in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pupillabs.pupilmobile).

The communication protocol is named [NDSI](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/master/ndsi-commspec.md), it is completely open. A reference client for Python exsits [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi).

## Supported Hardware

- Moto Z2 Play

- Other Android Devices with USBC ports - While other Android devices with USBC ports can theoretically run Pupil Mobile and support Pupil headsets, we have found that not all USBC controllers are created equal and not all vendors provide full support of the USBC spec.
